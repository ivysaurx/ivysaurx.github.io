      <h3>Sketch of the Design</h3>
      <img src="finalproject_sketch.PNG"/>
      <p>The way this contraption works is that it utilizes gravity. The stepper motor, with a plastic rectangle attached to it, has a primary function of rotating.
        If I push a button, the stepper motor will rotate the plastic about 90 degrees.
        When the plastic is in a certain position, it covers a hole at the bottom of the jar. When the stepper motor rotates and pauses at a certain position, the
        hole is uncovered and rice falls out into the container underneath!
      </p>
      <img src="finalproject_explain1.PNG"/>
      <p>Above is an image of the stepper motor and a ULN2003A. The stepper motor connects to the ULN2003A, which has 4 input pins, a power and a ground pin, and an area that connects 
        the stepper motor to the ULN2003A, which then is connected to the Arduino.
      </p>

      <h3>Schematic</h3>
      <img src="finalproject_schematic.PNG"/>
      <p>This is my schematic. I used a 10k Ohm resistor to bring the button to ground. The schematic on the right, however, has resistors built into its structure,
        which means I did not need any additional resistors to use it. It uses a 2.7k, a 7.2k, and a 3k resistor. It also has 4 input pins, which I had connected
        pins 8 to 11 on the Arduino to.
      </p>

      <h3>Code</h3>
      <code>
        #include <Stepper.h> // allows the use of the Stepper library, which acts as the output <br>
            const int revolution = 2048;<br>
            const int qtrPerRevolution = 512;<br>
            // constants won't change. They're used here to set pin numbers:<br>
            const int buttonPin = 2;  // the number of the pushbutton pin<br>
            // use pin 8-11 to IN1-IN4<br>
            Stepper stepper = Stepper(revolution, 8, 10, 9, 11);<br>
            <br>
            // variables will change:<br>
            int buttonState = 0;  // variable for reading the pushbutton status<br>
            <br>
            void setup() {<br>
              // initialize the button as input and stepper's initial speed<br>
              pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);<br>
              stepper.setSpeed(10); //sets the speed of stepper motor to 10 revolutions per minute<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            void loop() {<br>
              // read the state of the pushbutton value:<br>
              buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);<br>
              <br>
              // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:<br>
              if (buttonState == HIGH) {<br>
                delay(100); //creates an arbitrary delay<br>
                stepper.step(qtrPerRevolution); //rotates the stepper motor 90 degrees<br>
              }<br>
            }
      </code>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>This had a lot of challenges. Even though, admittedly, this looks like a crafts project, it was mechanically much more difficult than what I had originally thought.
        My original sketch actually had the hole on the side of the box, and I was expecting the pressure to shoot the rice out easily. I also had the complication of the weight of the rice
        , which changed my original plan of a Servo motor to a Stepper motor. <br>
        I had to melt a hole the box, which caused several smoke alarms to go off. The melted plastic also, then, blocked the way of the rectangular plastic from even moving. Then I realized
        that the rice was, in fact, not going to smoothly come out, which meant I had to rotate the entire box, which messed up the placement of my wires a bit. Then, my stepper motor burned
        out and I had to quickly purchase a pack of new ones and had to do a little bit of debugging on the code.<br>
        It turned out that it was not easy at all, but thankfully, I had managed to do it with a satisfying result!
