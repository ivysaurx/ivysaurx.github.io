      <p>Here is all the documentation for assignment 1!</p>
      <img src="a1_gif.gif" style="width:240px;height:427px;"/>
      <p>Above is a gif of my working circuit! As you can see, each red LED blinks independently.</p>
      <img src="a1_schematic.jpg" />
      <p>Above is the schematic that shows my usage of three pins, three resistors, and three LED lights that all connect back to ground.</p>

        <code>
          // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
          void setup() {
            // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
            pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
            pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
            pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
          }
          
          // the loop function runs over and over again forever
          void loop() {
            digitalWrite(8, HIGH);  // turn the LED #1 on (HIGH is the voltage level)
            delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
            digitalWrite(8, LOW);   // turn the LED #1 off by making the voltage LOW
            delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
            digitalWrite(9, HIGH);  // turn the LED #2 on (HIGH is the voltage level)
            delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
            digitalWrite(9, LOW);   // turn the LED #2 off by making the voltage LOW
            delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
            digitalWrite(10, HIGH);  // turn the LED #3 on (HIGH is the voltage level)
            delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
            digitalWrite(10, LOW);   // turn the LED #3 off by making the voltage LOW
            delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
            
          }
        </code>

      <p>The code above allows the LEDs of different pins to blink.</p>
      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <img src="a1_graph.jpg"/>
      <p>The number of LEDs that can be blinked independently would be 14, which would draw about 0.2A. This is explained below.</p>
      <img src="a1_math.jpg"/>
      <p>The speed of that the lights could be blinking independently is at 60 hZ for the human eye to be unable to keep up.</p>
