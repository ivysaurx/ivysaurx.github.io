      <p>Left is a gif of my working circuit! As you can see, each red LED blinks independently.</p>

      <p>Above is the schematic that shows my usage of three pins(Pin 10, 9, and 8), three resistors (each 220 Ohms), and three LED lights that all connect back to ground.</p>

        <code>
          // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board <br>
          void setup() {<br>
            // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.<br>
            pinMode(8, OUTPUT);<br>
            pinMode(9, OUTPUT);<br>
            pinMode(10, OUTPUT);<br>
          }<br>
          <br>
          // the loop function runs over and over again forever<br>
          void loop() {<br>
            digitalWrite(8, HIGH);  // turn the LED #1 on (HIGH is the voltage level)<br>
            delay(1000);                      // wait for a second<br>
            digitalWrite(8, LOW);   // turn the LED #1 off by making the voltage LOW<br>
            delay(1000);                      // wait for a second<br>
            digitalWrite(9, HIGH);  // turn the LED #2 on (HIGH is the voltage level)<br>
            delay(1000);                      // wait for a second<br>
            digitalWrite(9, LOW);   // turn the LED #2 off by making the voltage LOW<br>
            delay(1000);                      // wait for a second<br>
            digitalWrite(10, HIGH);  // turn the LED #3 on (HIGH is the voltage level)<br>
            delay(1000);                      // wait for a second<br>
            digitalWrite(10, LOW);   // turn the LED #3 off by making the voltage LOW<br>
            delay(1000);                      // wait for a second<br>
            <br>
          }<br>
        </code>

      <p>The code above allows the LEDs of different pins to blink.</p>
      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <img src="a1_graph.jpg" style="width:1039px;height:757px;"/>
      <p>The number of LEDs that can be blinked independently would be 14, which would draw about 0.2A. This is explained below.</p>
      <img src="a1_math.jpg" style="width:975px;height:531px;"/>
      <p>The speed of that the lights could be blinking independently was around 10 ms for me to be unable to keep up.</p>
