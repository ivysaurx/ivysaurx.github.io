      <p>Above is a gif of my working circuit! As you can see, each red LED blinks independently.</p>

      <p>Above is the schematic that shows my usage of three pins, three resistors, and three LED lights that all connect back to ground.</p>
      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <img src="a1_graph.jpg"/>
      <p>The number of LEDs that can be blinked independently would be 14, which would draw about 0.2A .</p>
      <p>The speed of that the lights could be blinking independently is at 60 hZ for the human eye to be unable to keep up.</p>
