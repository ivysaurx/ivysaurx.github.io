    <p>This is the circuit itself! The gif on the top of the page shows the function itself of the circuit.</p>

    <p>This is why I chose the resistors that I had chosen for my circuit. I had chosen a 220 Ohm resistor and a 10K Ohm resistor.</p>

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <p>Draw a chart where X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), 
        analogWrite(led,128), and analogWrite(led, 255).</p>
      <img src="a2_graph.PNG"/>
      <p>This graph shows a red LED that uses 1.8 voltage and it flashing at different speeds due to the effects of analogWrite at different values.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</p>
      <img src="a2_additionalq2.PNG"/>
      <p>With my schematic, circuit, and firmware, it would run for about 55.17 hours, assuming that the button was held the entire time!</p>
